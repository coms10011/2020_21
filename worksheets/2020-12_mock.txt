What is an _event_?
a Something that happens.
b A subset of the sample space.
c A possible outcome of an experiment.
d A subset that depends on the outcome.

The answer is b), the sample space is the set of outcomes; an event is a set of outcomes, for example the values a roll of a die has outcomes {1,2,3,4,5,6}, an event would be "an even result": {2,4,6}, the events can include the singleton sets {1}.

A sample space consists of the words {stately, plump, buck, mulligan, came, from, the, stairhead}. The event $A$ consists of all words with four or fewer letters. The event $B$ consists of all words ending in a vowel. For this question 'y' is not a vowel. What is $P(B)$ and $P(A|B)$?
 a) $P(B)=1/2$ and $P(A|B)=1/4$
 b) $P(B)=1/4$ and $P(A|B)=1/2$
 c) $P(B)=1/2$ and $P(A|B)=1/2$
 d) $P(B)=1/4$ and $P(A|B)=1$

The answer is d. There are two words ending in a vowel and eight words in total 2/8=1/4. All these words have four or fewer letters so P(A|B)=1. Bonus point if you recognize the quote.

An unfair coin gives heads with probability 2/3; it is tossed ten times, what is the probability of four heads? Give your answer in the form '0.abc'.

You are calculating (10 pick 4) (2/3)^4 (1/3)^6 and 10 pick 4 is 10X9X8X7 / (2X3X4)

For a Poisson process let $T$ be the interval for which the
process has, on average, one event, so, for this interval $\lambda=1$. What is the probability that there is one event for this interval? Give your answer in the form '0.ab'.

So apply the formula lambda^1/1! exp(-lambda) where 1! = 1

In a school with 1000 pupils 50 are taking part in the school
production of the play 'Guys and Dolls'. Because of the glamour
associated with being in theatre when asked if they are in the play
students who aren't actually in the play sometimes lie; in fact a
non-participating student has a 0.1 change of saying they are in the
play when they aren't. Conversely three students who are in 'Guys and
Dolls' also play on the school sports teams and by tradition they also
lie, claiming they are not in the play when in fact they are. If
someone says they are in the play what is the chance they really are?
Give you answer in the form '0.ab'.

C - claiming to be in the play
A - being in the play

we are told P(C|!A)=0.1 and P(C|A) = 47/50 = 0.94 where 47 = 50 - three jocks

we want P(A|C) = P(C|A)P(A)/ P(C) so the bit we dont have is P(C) since P(A) the probability you are in the play is 0.05 =  50/1000

P(C) = P(C|A)P(A) + P(C|!A)P(!A) the probability of claiming to be in the play is the probabilty of claiming to be in the play if you are in the play by the probability of being in the play plus the probability of claiming to be in the play if you aren't in the play by the probability you aren't in the play
so
P(C) = 0.94 X 0.05 + 0.1 X 0.95

The weight of the eggs laid by a particular chicken has an
approximately Gaussian distribution with $\mu=50$ g and variance
$\sigma^2=25 $ g$^2$. Write down an expression in terms of the error
function for the probability of finding a egg bigger than 65 g.

a) $[1-\mbox{erf}(3/\sqrt{2})]/2$
b) $[1-\mbox{erf}(3\sqrt{2})]/2$
c) $[1-\mbox{erf}(5\sqrt{2})]/2$
d) $[1-\mbox{erf}(5/\sqrt{2})]/2$

The answer is a, z= (x-mu)/(sqrt(2) sigma) and we know mu = 50 and
sigma = 5 so for 65 we have (65-50) / (sqrt(2) 5) = 3 / sqrt(3). The
other limit is infinity and inf(infinity)=1

The _Erlang_ distribution has probability density $p(x)=\lambda^kx^{k-1}e^{-\lambda x}/(k-1)!$. What is its mean?

a) $k$
b) $k/\lambda$
c) $k\lambda$
d) $\lambda$

b) is the answer. If this is a probability distribution we know
    1 = int l^k x^{​k-1}​ exp(-lx)/(k-1)!dx
where I am writing l for lambda. diff wrt to l
    0 =  int kl^{​k-1) x^{​k-1}​exp(-lx)/(k-1)!dx + int l^k x^{​k-1}​(-x)exp(-lx)/(k-1)!dx
Now multiply and divide the first term by l and bring the second term to the other side of the = sign.
    int x l^k x^{​k-1}​ exp(-lx)/(k-1)! dx = k/l int l^k x^{​k-1}​exp(-lx) / (k-1)! dx
So the right hand side is the first moment <X> and the left hand side is k/l times <1>=1.

They say there is no smoke without fire, but imagine that
the probability of smoke when there is a fire is 0.9 whereas the probability
of smoke when there is no fire is 0.05. Now, say the probability of a
fire is 0.01, if there is smoke, what is the probability that there is a
fire? Give your answer in the form '0.abc'.

0.154 (+- 0.001 accepted)

F is fire, S is smoke, we want P(F|S)=P(S|F)P(F)/P(S) and we know
P(S|F)=0.9 and P(S|!F)=0.05 and P(F)=0.01 so all you need is P(S) and
as with the guys and dols question we have

P(S) = P(S|F)P(F)+P(S|!F)P(!F)

Two six-sided dice are rolled and the face values are summed. What is
the variance of the result? Give your answer in the form 'a.bc'.

5.83 (+- 0.01)

the probabilities are
2 or 12 1/36
3 or 11 2/36
4 or 10 3/36
5 or 9  4/36
6 or 8  5/36
7       1/6

and so the average is 14*15/36 + 7/6 = 7 which you might've guessed anyway, the second moment is
(4+144)*1/36 + (9+121) *2/36 + . . . + 49*1/6 ~ 54.83 and then subtract the 49

A five card poker hand is a straight if the card values are
consecutive, as for example $4,5,6,7,8$; the ace can be considered
lower than $2$ or higher than a king, so $A,2,3,4,5$ and $10,J,Q,K,A$
are both legitimate straights; however, if a straight contains an ace
it must be the lower or highest card, $Q,K,A,1,2$ is not a legitimate
straight. The suits do not need to be the same. How many different hands are straights

10 choices for the first card, 4 choices of suit for each of five cards is 10*4^5

This is a badly set question, in poker a "straight" excludes the
straight-flushes, straights where all the suits are the same; the
question should've made it clear whether these were included or not,
an exam question should avoid that ambiguity and would certainly mark
either as correct. If you want to exclude the straight-flushes, there
are 40 of them, ten choices of starting card, four choices of
suits. This leave
