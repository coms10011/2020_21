\fi In the novel \textit{Swallows and Amazons} the children write to
their father asking permission to sail out to an island to camp, he famously replies by telegram
\begin{quote}
  BETTER DROWNED THAN DUFFERS IF NOT DUFFERS WON'T DROWN
\end{quote}
`duffers' is old-fashioned posh-English slang for a fool chiefly
remembered because of its appearance in this quote. The father, as
befits an old-fashioned Edwardian-style\footnote{In fact the novel
  takes place in 1929 so he's not actually Edwardian} paterfamilis does not
express himself in terms of probabilities, but imagine a duffer has a
one in five chance of drowning and a non-duffer a one in fifty,
imagine also that one person in four is a duffer. If a child survives
the trip what is the chance they are nonetheless a duffer?

\noindent \textbf{solution} We are interested in
\begin{equation}
  P(\mbox{duffer}|\mbox{not drowned})=\frac{P(\mbox{not drowned}|\mbox{duffer})P(\mbox{duffer})}{P(\mbox{not drowned})}
\end{equation}
Now $P(\mbox{not drowned}|\mbox{duffer})=0.8$ and $P(\mbox{duffer})=0.25$, working out $P(\mbox{not drowned})$ takes more work:
\begin{eqnarray}
  P(\mbox{not drowned})&=&P(\mbox{not drowned}|\mbox{duffer})P(\mbox{duffer})\cr&& +P(\mbox{not drowned}|\mbox{not duffer})P(\mbox{not duffer})\cr &=&0.8\times 0.25+0.98\times 0.75=0.935
\end{eqnarray}
and hence
\begin{equation}
  P(\mbox{duffer}|\mbox{not drowned})=\frac{0.8\times 0.25}{0.935}\approx 0.214
\end{equation}
so if a child survives their summer camping trip, there is still a
good chance they are duffer.
